# Roadmap

## Unsolved Problems

- Submitting a new card to be added to the selected deck does not clear the form.
- newDeckCard state is dependent on input of newDeckCard forms. Submitting a different 'card' will submit the card where qty was last inputted.

## Future Enhancements

- User Authentication with Firebase.
- Delete or Update function to remove a set of cards from the selected deck.
- Reorganize components to sensible React components (currently a single Index Component with 6 states)
- General Styling
- New page component to test playing selected deck.
